1. Map of word/phrase extracted alignments using techniques of Koehn 2003
2. For different corpora, languages
=> In Parallel + argmax combination with different languages on same corpus
=> In Series with multiple corpora (deep linking)
   -- Same domain vs. cross-domain paraphrasing (Future work: Twitter, translation into microblogging forms of communication etc.)
=> Combination of the two (Multiple different languages to start with, ORDERING of languages within series)

Twitter Decompression is possible, but existing corpora cannot publically provide tweets, leading to many mining problems.
=> Rate limiting limits the ability to mine these tweets in a reasonable time span, especially for an academic project.
=> Many of the tweets have been deleted for one reason or another, drastically reducing the size of the corpus.
